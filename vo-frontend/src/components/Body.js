                    Mohammed Aamir Hussain Khan (pronounced [ˈaːmɪr xaːn]; born 14 March 1965) is an Indian actor, singer, director, filmmaker, and television talk show host. Through his career spanning over 30 years in Hindi films, Khan has established himself as one of the most popular and influential actors of Indian cinema.[2][3] He has a large global following, especially in India and China, and has been described by Newsweek as "the biggest movie star"[4][5] in the world.[6][7][8] Khan is the recipient of numerous awards, including nine Filmfare Awards, four National Film Awards, and an AACTA Award. He was honoured by the Government of India with the Padma Shri in 2003 and the Padma Bhushan in 2010,[9] and received an honorary title from the Government of China in 2017.[10] For years, he has been regularly listed one among The 500 Most Influential Muslims of the world.[11][12]

                    Khan first appeared on screen as a child actor in his uncle Nasir Hussain's film Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973). As an adult, his first feature film role was in the experimental film Holi (1984). He began a full-time acting career with a leading role in Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). His performance in Raakh earned him a National Film Award in the Special Mention category. He established himself as a leading actor in Hindi cinema in the 1990s by appearing in a number of commercially successful films, including Dil, Raja Hindustani—for which he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor—and Sarfarosh.[13][14] He also played against type in 1947: Earth.[15]

                    In 1999 he founded Aamir Khan Productions, whose first film, Lagaan (2001), was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and earned him a National Film Award for Best Popular Film and two more Filmfare Awards (Best Actor and Best Film). After a four-year absence from the screen, Khan returned to appear in leading roles, notably in Fanaa and Rang De Basanti. He made his directorial debut with Taare Zameen Par (2007), which won him the Filmfare Awards for Best Film and Best Director. Khan's greatest global successes came with Ghajini, 3 Idiots, Dhoom 3, PK, and Dangal, each having held the record for being the highest-grossing Indian film,[16] while Secret Superstar[17] holds the record for being the highest-grossing Indian film featuring a female protagonist.[18] Khan won his third Best Actor award at Filmfare for Dangal.[19] His films are known for dealing with social issues in Indian society,[20] and they often combine the entertainment and production values of commercial masala films with the believable narratives and strong messages of parallel cinema.[21]

                    Khan is an activist[20] and humanitarian, and has participated and spoken out for various social causes, some of which have sparked political controversy. He is the lead donor of IPS media foundation that has funded Indian news websites like Scroll.in, The Wire and many others.[22] He created and hosted the television talk show Satyamev Jayate, through which he highlights sensitive social issues in India, occasionally influencing the Indian parliament. His work as a social reformer, tackling issues ranging from poverty and education to abuse and discrimination, earned him an appearance on the Time 100 list of most influential people in the world.[20] Khan was married to his first wife, Reena Dutta, for fifteen years, after which he married film director Kiran Rao. He has three children—two with Dutta, and one with Rao through surrogacy.
